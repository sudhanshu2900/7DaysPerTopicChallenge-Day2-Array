PROBLEM: N = 3, arr[] = {1,1,2} 

Output: 2

Explanation: The candles' length reduce by 1 in 1 day. So, at the end of day 1: Sizes would be 0 0 1, So, at end of day 2: Sizes would be 0 0 0. This means 
             the room was illuminated for 2 days.
             
             
SOLUTION:

int maxDays(int arr[],int n){
        int max=arr[0];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i]>=max){
                max=arr[i];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
